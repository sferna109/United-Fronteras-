The long-term goal of <strong>United Fronteras</strong> is to engage with borderlands around the world to compare the experiences of these regions, bringing forward perspectives that oftentimes contradict the sentiments of division that are frequently influenced and represented by those in power. By engaging with this project, Humanities scholars are learning digital humanities practices through their research. This will prepare scholars to use both research and digital platforms/tools as new forms of social interventions to:

<ul>
<li>Use technology as resistance</li>
<li>Trace a digital record of the borderlands</li>
<li>Reach borderland communities</li>
<li>Deconstruct geopolitical boundaries</li>
<li>Document past and present daily lives at the borders</li>
<li>Share and create knowledge from personal experiences</li>
<li>Decentralize the discourse/rhetoric about the borderlands</li>
<li>Revisit and interpret historical records and narratives through a new lens</li>
<li>Expand the notion of digital humanities from borderlands communities</li>
</ul>

The core values of <strong>United Fronteras</strong> are principles that guide our mission, vision, goals, objectives and creation procedures:

<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Interdisciplinarity</li>
<li>Non-hierarchical Leadership</li>

</ul>

<em>This is a living Mission Statement that will evolve as the project continues to develop.</em>
