## Projects to include

Please help us grow our database by including projects that work with material related to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands from pre-colonial times to the present.

This includes all states from the U.S. Southwest (California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas), other states that were under Spanish colonial rule in the 1800s (Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida), as well as all the Northern states of Mexico (Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas).

*Indigenous work can range from pre-colonial times to the present*

Projects need to have a digital component, either presently active or inactive.

- Active Projects: include the title and a link to the project.
- Inactive: include the title and any information that can help us trace the project.
