MEET THE TEAM

Who we are?

We are Digital Humanities scholars from various disciplines and universities. The team is composed mostly of women and border natives from various regions of the Mexico-U.S. border; the few who are not border natives have experienced this borderland, particularly and closely, through their lived experiences with (im)migration procedures and/or in their research.
