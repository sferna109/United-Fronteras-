## Meet the team: Who we are?

We are Digital Humanities scholars from various disciplines and universities. The team is composed mostly of women and border natives from various regions of the Mexico-U.S. border; the few who are not border natives have experienced this borderland, particularly and closely, through their lived experiences with (im)migration procedures and/or in their research.
